3. The Agile Revolution (2001-Present):
   In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
This is the first phase, where project goals, scope, and feasibility are analyzed.
The budget is defined, timeline, required resources, and risks.
2. Requirements Analysis
In this phase, software requirements are gathered from stakeholders (clients, users, business teams etc).
Functional and non-functional requirements are documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
3. Design
The system’s architecture and UI/UX are designed based on requirements.
Software components, database structures, and technologies are selected.
4. Implementation (Coding)
Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are used.
5. Testing
The software undergoes quality assurance (QA) testing to detect and fix bugs.
6. Deployment
The software is released to production or end users.
Can be done in stages (Beta release, Pilot testing) or all at once.
7. Maintenance & Support
Developers provide updates, bug fixes, and security patches after release.
Performance monitoring ensures the system runs smoothly.
Outcome: Continuous improvements and issue resolution

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Definition:

Waterfall is a linear and sequential software development methodology.
Each phase (Planning → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next.
Key Characteristics:
Rigid structure – No changes allowed after a phase is completed.
Extensive documentation – Each phase requires detailed documentation.
Long development cycles – Software is delivered as a complete product at the end.
Less customer involvement – Requirements are set at the beginning and rarely change

Agile Methodology
Definition:
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development.
Work is done in small cycles (sprints), with continuous feedback and adaptation.
Key Characteristics:
Highly flexible – Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration.
Iterative development – Software is built and delivered in small, functional increments.
Continuous customer involvement – Regular feedback leads to better alignment with user needs.
Minimal documentation – Focuses more on working software than detailed reports.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing
🔹 Definition:
Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (functions, methods, or classes) of a software application in isolation.
🔹 Purpose & Importance:
✔ Ensures that each module works as expected before integrating it into the system.
✔ Helps detect bugs early, reducing debugging costs later in development.
✔ Supports code refactoring by confirming that changes don’t break existing functionality.
✔ Improves code quality through well-defined test cases.
🔹 Example:
In a banking app, a unit test might check whether a calculateInterest() function returns the correct interest amount for a given principal.
Developers typically use testing frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or Mocha (JavaScript) for unit testing.

3. Integration Testing
🔹 Definition:
Integration testing verifies that multiple components or modules work together correctly after unit testing.
🔹 Purpose & Importance:
✔ Ensures that different software modules interact as expected (e.g., API calls, database connections).
✔ Detects interface defects, such as data mismatches between modules.
✔ Validates how external systems (e.g., third-party APIs, payment gateways) interact with the application.
🔹 Example:
In an e-commerce system, an integration test might check whether the "Add to Cart" feature correctly updates the inventory database.
Tools like Postman (for APIs), Selenium, and JUnit are commonly used for integration testing.

3. System Testing
🔹 Definition:
System testing evaluates the entire application to ensure it meets all technical and business requirements. It is conducted in an environment that simulates real-world usage.
🔹 Purpose & Importance:
✔ Tests the complete software system for bugs and inconsistencies.
✔ Ensures that all components work together in a real-world environment.
✔ Covers performance, security, and usability aspects of the software.
✔ Helps find unexpected behavior when modules interact under real conditions.
🔹 Example:
In a ride-hailing app, system testing ensures that a user can request a ride, process payments, and receive notifications correctly.
Performed using automated tools (Selenium, JMeter) and manual testing.

5. Acceptance Testing
🔹 Definition:
Acceptance testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, UAT) determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
🔹 Purpose & Importance:
✔ Ensures that the software aligns with customer expectations and real-world use cases.
✔ Performed by end-users or clients before final release.
✔ Identifies any gaps between expected vs. actual performance.
✔ Acts as the final approval step before software goes live.
🔹 Example:
A hospital management system undergoes UAT where doctors and nurses test the system to confirm that patient records are accessible and appointments can be scheduled properly.
Often conducted using real-world test cases and feedback-driven iterations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
