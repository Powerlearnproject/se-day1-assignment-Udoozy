Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer:
Software is a process of designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software.
#The Importance of Software engineering in the technology industries are:
1. Scalability and Maintainability - Software is built to handle growing users and data efficiently.
2. Cost and Time Savings - Prevents project failures by following systematic approaches.
3. Security and Reliability - Software engineering practices help prevent cyber threats
4. Supports Innovation and Business Growth - Enables businesses to automate processes and enhance user experience.
5. Global Impact - Software engineering powers industries such as finance, healthcare, education, and transportation.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s):
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in Germany.
The conference addressed the "software crisis"—the growing challenge of building reliable, maintainable, and scalable software.
2.  Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s): 
The introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with languages like Simula (1967) and Smalltalk (1972).
3. The Agile Revolution (2001-Present):
   In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
This is the first phase, where project goals, scope, and feasibility are analyzed.
The budget is defined, timeline, required resources, and risks.
2. Requirements Analysis
In this phase, software requirements are gathered from stakeholders (clients, users, business teams etc).
Functional and non-functional requirements are documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
3. Design
The system’s architecture and UI/UX are designed based on requirements.
Software components, database structures, and technologies are selected.
4. Implementation (Coding)
Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are used.
5. Testing
The software undergoes quality assurance (QA) testing to detect and fix bugs.
6. Deployment
The software is released to production or end users.
Can be done in stages (Beta release, Pilot testing) or all at once.
7. Maintenance & Support
Developers provide updates, bug fixes, and security patches after release.
Performance monitoring ensures the system runs smoothly.
Outcome: Continuous improvements and issue resolution

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Definition:

Waterfall is a linear and sequential software development methodology.
Each phase (Planning → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next.
Key Characteristics:
Rigid structure – No changes allowed after a phase is completed.
Extensive documentation – Each phase requires detailed documentation.
Long development cycles – Software is delivered as a complete product at the end.
Less customer involvement – Requirements are set at the beginning and rarely change

Agile Methodology
Definition:
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development.
Work is done in small cycles (sprints), with continuous feedback and adaptation.
Key Characteristics:
Highly flexible – Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration.
Iterative development – Software is built and delivered in small, functional increments.
Continuous customer involvement – Regular feedback leads to better alignment with user needs.
Minimal documentation – Focuses more on working software than detailed reports.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

 Software Developer
Role:
A Software Developer (or Software Engineer) is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications based on project requirements.
Responsibilities:
1 Writing Code – Develops and writes clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
2 Software Design – Designs software architecture and database structures.
3 Debugging & Troubleshooting – Fixes bugs and optimizes performance.
4 Collaboration – Works with designers, testers, and project managers.
5 Version Control Management – Uses tools like Git for source code management.
6 Code Reviews – Reviews and improves code quality through peer reviews.
7 Documentation – Creates technical documentation for future maintenance.
Example Task:
Developing a new feature for a mobile banking app.
Optimizing a web application’s performance for faster loading.

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Role:
A QA Engineer ensures that the software is reliable, functional, and free from defects before deployment.
Responsibilities:
1. Test Planning & Execution – Creates test plans, test cases, and executes them.
2. Automated & Manual Testing – Uses tools like Selenium, JUnit, or manual testing to identify bugs.
3. Bug Tracking & Reporting – Reports issues and works with developers to fix them.
4. Performance & Security Testing – Ensures software runs efficiently and securely.
5. Regression Testing – Tests previous functionalities after new changes.
 Ensuring Compliance – Ensures the software meets industry standards and requirements.
Example Task:
Performing stress testing on a ticket booking system to handle high traffic.
Automating login functionality tests to verify user authentication works properly.

3. Project Manager (PM)
Role:
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects, ensuring they are completed on time and within budget.
Responsibilities:
1 Project Planning – Defines project scope, objectives, and timelines.
2 Team Coordination – Assigns tasks and ensures collaboration between developers, QA engineers, and other team members.
3 Risk Management – Identifies and mitigates risks to avoid project delays.
4 Stakeholder Communication – Acts as a bridge between clients, executives, and development teams.
5 Budget & Resource Management – Allocates resources and monitors costs.
6 Agile & Scrum Management – Uses methodologies like Agile and Scrum to streamline workflow.
7 Monitoring Progress – Uses tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana to track project status.

Example Task:
Coordinating a two-week sprint for a software release.
Managing client expectations and ensuring all requirements are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
